            <p>
              Hello world! My name is Timothy, I am currently living in Toronto.

            <p>
            As a recent graduate in the world of web development, I have immersed myself in the art of coding and found it to be not just a profession but a creative outlet. My journey has been filled with curiosity, countless lines of code, and a drive to craft solutions that make a real impact. From front-end design to back-end functionality, I have embraced the full spectrum of web development, and I am eager to showcase my projects that reflect my dedication and growth in this dynamic field. I am excited about what the future holds, and I am here to contribute my skills to exciting projects and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts. Welcome to my coding journey!

              I recently completed the University of Toronto Coding Bootcamp in October 2023.
